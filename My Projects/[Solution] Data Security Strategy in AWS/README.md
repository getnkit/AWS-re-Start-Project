# Data Security Strategy in AWS
## Scenario
* A bank manager approached an Amazon Web Services (AWS) product manager about a data leak that occurred 6 months ago. As a result of the leak, the bank lost money.
* The bank manager has concluded that it's time to make fundamental changes to the bank's systems operations. The manager isn't satisfied with the efficiency of the bank's systems operators. The manager also has concerns about the security of sensitive customer information and the stability of the bank's systems. The manager has lost confidence in the expertise of the SysOps team. This situation has driven the manager to approach AWS.
